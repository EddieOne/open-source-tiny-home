This stylish small cottage makes a terrific, budget-friendly getaway for a double-date weekend or a small family. 
The spacious front porch offers plenty of room to sit and enjoy the sunset. 
Inside, curl up by the wood stove in the living room or enjoy a meal in the surprisingly roomy eat-in kitchen. 
An open layout makes it easy to socialize, even while cooking. 
Two bedrooms share a full hall bath (including a stall shower) in the back. 
Who knew you could do so much with 480 square feet?
